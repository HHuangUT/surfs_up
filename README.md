## Overview
Analyze temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
### Metric 1: Mean
Comparing **mean** temperature across both months:

- June: 74.94 F
- December: 71.04 F

The difference between the average temperature for both months is 3.9 F degrees, suggesting year-long consitency.
### Metric 2: Standard Deviation
Comparing **standard deviation** of temperature across both months:

- June: 3.26
- December: 3.74

The difference between the deviations in temperature for both months 0.48, suggesting similar variance in temps and year-long consitency.

### Metric 3: Min Med & Max
Comparing **minimum, maximum, and median** of temperatures across both months:

- June
    - Min: 64
    - Max: 85
    - Median: 75
- December
    - Min: 56
    - Max: 83
    - Median: 71

The difference between the two months are very slim. The biggest difference is in the minimum temperature, where December had a 56 F occurance (a surf shop can still sell wetsuits), and both max temps were over 80 F. Overall, this bodes well for opening up the shops.

## Summary

After analyzing temperature data across June and December, the data shows that the weather is consistent enough year round to open a surf and ice cream shop.
